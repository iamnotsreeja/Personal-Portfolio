            Thankyou for showing interest in me. My programming journey started back in 2018, 
            while I was in class 8(ICSE board iykyk) 
            I am currently in my first
            year studying Computer Science and Engineering at Kiit University,
            Bhubaneshwar and doing this and that . I am also kind of
            participating in 100 days coding challenge by Google because
            this helps me to keep coding in practice.From the very beggining I love coding
            and coming into this field increased my excitation and thrill.
            I love making projects.This is my third project in HTML and CSS as I am still learning 
            it so I started of with comparitively easy.<br>
            <br>Languages known : C , JAVA, Python (basic).
            <br>
            HTML, CSS, LINUX, and GitHub.
